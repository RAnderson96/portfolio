                    <p>
                        I am a motivated and driven individual, a quick learner and a keen problem solver who enjoys learning to code.
                        I graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a Masters of Mechanical Engineering in June 2019 and started Codeclan in September of 2022.

                    <p>
                        During my time at University I started coding with Matlab and fell in love with it. In September 2022 I decided to take the leap and change career to retrain as a Full Stack Software Developer with CodeClan. </p>

                        I am very excited for the journey ahead, thanks for reading.
