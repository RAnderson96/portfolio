                <p>
                I am a quick learner, keen problem solver and a motivated and driven individual who enjoys learning to code.
                I graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a First-Class Honours Master of Mechanical Engineering in June 2019. During my time at University 
                I started coding with Matlab and fell in love with coding. In September 2022 I decided to take the leap and change career to retrain as a Software Developer.
